## Introduction and purpose
This project is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of the project is to determine largest number and smallest number of numbers entered from keyboard with specified times. The user is asked how many numbers to enter and a value is expected.

## Algorithm
To find largest and smallest number of group of numbers, very popular and known algorithm is applied. Initially, largest number assigned to -&infin; and smallest number is assigned to +&infin;.

If entered number is greater than -&infin;, entered number is assigned as the largest number. If entered number is smallest than +&infin;, entered number is assigned as the smallest number. This process repeats until entering number is finished.  And finally, largest and smallest numbers are found.
